# kmeans algorithm
A frame-by-frame representation of implementation of a k-means algorithm with k = 3 in 2 dimensions.

This sketch demonstrates how the k-means algorithm iteratively works in order to 
group a given set of data in k clusters.

k is hardcoded to be three in this example and the data here is 2 - Dimensional.

I've tried explaining the k-means algorithm intuitively in this small post with an analogy.
